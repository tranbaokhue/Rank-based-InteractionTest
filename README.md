<h2 align="center">New Nonparametric Tests for Interaction in Two-way Layout with Replications<br>
🧮📙🎏📊🖥️ </h2>
<p align="center">A repository for R codes and research on the two new aligned rank-based test statistics APCSSA and APCSSM. </p>

## About the tests
The two test statistics were developed by Amy Wagaman (Amherst College) and Bradley Hartlaub (Kenyon College) to test for interaction effects in general two-way layouts with balanced replications per cell. These new nonparametric procedures are **APCSSA** and **APCSSM**, where *APC* is the abbreviation for "All Possible Comparisons" and *A* and *M* corresponds with "Average" and "Median" for the alignment method. 

## Table of contents
In this repository, we provide the following:
- For all settings with 2 to 6 levels in each main factors and the number of replications per cell ranging from 1 to 5:
    - Null distributions for both tests  using Monte Carlo simulation
    - Expected values, variances as well as critical values for both tests
- Codes for the interaction tests APCSSA and APCSSM
- Codes to generate null distributions and find critical values for settings with over 6 levels in a factor
