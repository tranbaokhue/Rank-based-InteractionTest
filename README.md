<h2 align="center">Nonparametric Tests for Interaction in Two-way Layout with Replications<br>

<p align="center">A repository for R codes and research on the two new aligned rank-based test statistics APCSSA and APCSSM. </p>

## About
The two test statistics were developed by Amy Wagaman (Amherst College) and Bradley Hartlaub (Kenyon College) to test for interaction effects in general two-way layouts with balanced replications per cell. These new nonparametric procedures are **APCSSA** and **APCSSM**, where *APC* is the abbreviation for "All Possible Comparisons" and *A* and *M* corresponds with "Average" and "Median" for the alignment method. Since these are new tests, we are researching their null distributions, conducting power studies to see their performance against the traditional F-test and several other well-known nonparametric tests, and creating R codes that will hopefully make the tests more accessible.
