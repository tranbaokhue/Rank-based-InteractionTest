<h2 align="center">Nonparametric Tests for Interaction in Two-way Layout with Replications<br>
 </h2>
<p align="center">A repository for R codes and the null distributions of the two aligned rank-based test statistics APCSSA and APCSSM. </p>

## Table of contents
In this repository, we provide the following:
- For all settings with 2 to 6 levels in each main factors and from 1 to 5 replications per cell:
    - Null distributions for both tests  using Monte Carlo simulation
    - Expected values, variances as well as critical values for both tests
- Codes for the interaction tests APCSSA and APCSSM
- Codes to generate null distributions and find critical values for settings with over 6 levels in a factor

## About the tests
The two test statistics were developed by Amy Wagaman (Amherst College) and Bradley Hartlaub (Kenyon College) to test for interaction effects in general two-way layouts with balanced replications per cell. These nonparametric procedures are **APCSSA** and **APCSSM**, where *APC* is the abbreviation for "All Possible Comparisons" and *A* and *M* corresponds with "Average" and "Median" for the alignment method. 

## Acknowledgements
Professor Amy Wagaman (Amherst College) and Professor Bradley Hartlaub (Kenyon College) have worked on this project over many years, and together with their undergraduate collaborators: David Jacobson (Amherst College), Dahyun (Jessica) Jeong (Amherst College), Andrew Nguyen (Kenyon College), and Khue Tran (Kenyon Colege), this repository for the interaction tests APCSSA/APCSSM is now available to everyone.
